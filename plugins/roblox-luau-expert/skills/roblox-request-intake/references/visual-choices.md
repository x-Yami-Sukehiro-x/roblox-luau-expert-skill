# Ask with examples, not design vocabulary

For new UI or a requested visual redesign, offer one grouped preference question
when toggle, motion or notification styles are unresolved. Do not ask again if
the user already chose, supplied a reference, asked you to decide, or wants an
existing interface matched. A bug fix does not need a style questionnaire.

## The guide and its link

The guide is the **Roblox UI style picker**: playable, labeled examples of ten
toggles (T1–T10), thirteen menu movements (M0–M12) picked separately for
opening and closing, ten notification styles (N1–N10), five ways to hide and
bring back the whole UI (O1–O5), three button feels (P1–P3), three tab switches
(S1–S3) and a window diagram that numbers its parts (W1–W22). The user picks,
presses **Copy my picks**, and pastes a summary such as
`Opening: M3 — Gentle pop`.

- **Hosted link:** <https://x-yami-sukehiro-x.github.io/roblox-luau-expert-skill/>. Use this
  exact URL. It is a public GitHub Pages site that anyone can open, rebuilt
  from `docs/visual-guide/index.html` on every push.
- **Offline copy:** `docs/visual-guide/index.html` in this repository, the GPT
  knowledge file `roblox-ui-style-picker.html`, and the plugin's
  `skills/roblox-request-intake/assets/roblox-ui-style-picker.html`. Offer it
  when the user says the hosted link does not open or asks for the file. In a
  GPT, find the knowledge file under `/mnt/data/` with Code Interpreter (or
  extract it from the ZIP), verify it exists, and link the real attachment:
  "Download and open this in your browser". Elsewhere, attach or give the path.
- Never invent another URL, and never claim a private page is public.
- If neither link is available, describe the options in plain words below; do
  not pretend the user saw an animation, and do not stall unrelated work.

## The question

Ask once, in one message, with the link first:

> Before I build it: open the style picker (link) and pick the toggle, how the
> menu opens and closes, and the notification you like — then paste your picks
> here. Or just describe it in your own words, or say "choose for you". My
> suggestion is **T1 + M1 + N1 + O1** (for a script hub, **N4** for
> notifications).

**The question is the final reply of the turn**, with the hosted link written
out in it. Hosts such as ChatGPT fold progress notes away, so a link placed in
an early note and followed by "checking the guidance…" is a link the user never
sees. Stop there: build nothing until they answer or say "choose for you".
Ask through the host's question tool where available. Source inspection and
the task contract can happen in the same turn, before the question. If the
preference is optional and no answer arrives, use the stated default and never
claim it was the user's choice. Record picks in `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` or the
portable context record, and carry them into every later edit of that UI.

## Reading the answer

Each code has one exact build in
`../../roblox-ui-components/references/style-recipes.md`, with a tested recipe
in `../../roblox-ui-components/assets/`. Build from the recipe; recolour only
through its `THEME` block.

Users also answer in their own words. Map them, say the mapping back in one
clause, and ask only if two readings produce different work:

| They say | Code |
|---|---|
| little sliding pill, iPhone switch | T1 |
| boxy / square switch | T2 |
| checkbox, square with a tick | T3 |
| two buttons, off and on side by side | T4 |
| button that lights up, stays pressed | T5 |
| eye icon, icon that switches | T6 |
| switch with a tick in the circle | T7 |
| switch with ON / OFF written in it | T8 |
| little light that turns on | T9 |
| round tick, circle checkbox | T10 |
| no animation, just appear | M0 |
| fade, gently appears | M1 |
| slides up a little | M2 |
| little pop, zooms in a bit | M3 |
| slides in from the side | M4 |
| opens out of the button | M5 |
| bouncy, springy | M6 |
| slides in from the right | M7 |
| comes up from the bottom, phone sheet | M8 |
| drops down from the top | M9 |
| zooms in toward me | M10 |
| bounces up a little | M11 |
| rows come in one by one | M12 |
| message at the bottom | N1 |
| message near the top | N2 |
| next to what I changed | N3 |
| popups stacked in the corner, like most script hubs | N4 |
| bar across the top that stays | N5 |
| popup in the middle, "are you sure" | N6 |
| popups in the top corner | N7 |
| one small line at the top that swaps | N8 |
| loading, then done | N9 |
| popup with an undo button | N10 |
| close it and a button brings it back | O1 |
| shrink into the button, minimise | O2 |
| fold up to the title bar | O3 |
| a tab on the side to pull it back | O4 |
| loading screen before the hub | O5 |
| changes colour when pressed | P1 |
| pushes in, clicky | P2 |
| lifts on hover | P3 |
| line under the tab | S1 |
| pill behind the tab | S2 |
| just highlight the tab | S3 |

Mixed answers are normal: "T1 but square" is T2; "M2 with less movement" is M2
at 8 px; "like N4 but at the top" is N7. "Pop in, fade out" is opening M3 and
closing M1 — one presenter with a separate `closeStyle`. For names of
window parts and words like "cleaner" or "make it pop", use `ui-words.md`.
Never ask someone to choose Cubic versus Quint or supply spring constants.

## Preserve function while changing style

Keep callbacks, selected values, keyboard/gamepad focus and touch activation
independent of the skin. Selected is persistent for a toggle or tab, not a
one-shot button. Hover must not erase focus, and refresh must not erase the
active state. An action button updates its own appearance, not a different
toggle's knob. Test focus on the launcher, close, each choice and toggle
separately.

One current owner per animated property; rapid open/close cannot let a stale
completion hide a new view. Cancel active animations on unload. Reduced motion
overrides the chosen style and still applies the final state. The guide
communicates intent; it does not prove Roblox geometry, engine timing or
accessibility behavior.

Notifications use the panel's surface entry. Show what happened with text and
an icon, queue bursts, bound the visible count, reflow smoothly and keep
primary controls clear. Time lifetime from arrival, pause for interaction, and
keep actionable errors until dismissed or resolved. Test a long message, a rapid
burst, dismissal during entrance, reflow and unload with pending timers.
